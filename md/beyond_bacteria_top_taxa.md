### Top 10 Bacterial Species in the Beyond Bacteria Cohort

The Beyond Bacteria cohort currently consists of four individuals. The
microbiome compositions of these four individuals varied greatly at the species
level. While in a few cases a given species was found among the top ten species
in more than one individual, in most cases the overlap was minimal. We describe
in more detail below the ten most abundant species across the entire cohort,
followed by a short discussion of your own sample.

One of the protocols used for the Beyond Bacteria samples is called
whole-genome shotgun (WGS) sequencing. This protocol randomly shears all of the
DNA present in a sample into small fragments (hence the name "shotgun"). These
small fragments of DNA are then read out on a sequencing instrument such as the
Illumina MiSeq. The result is a vast collection of small sequences from all
over the genomes of everything in your sample. These sequencing fragments can
then be compared against existing reference databases to assess taxonomy and
gene function. As WGS sequences everything, we're able to get a much higher
level of specificity on the organisms that are represented in a sample. In
contrast, the 16S rDNA protocol used for the standard American Gut sample
focuses only on a small region of a single gene which greatly limits its power
to differentiate strains or species.

#### 1. *Lactobacillus gasseri*

The name *Lactobacillus gasseri* likely brings to mind thoughts of probiotics, as
*Lactobacilli* strains are often used in probiotic mixtures. *L. gasseri* is no
exception; it, too, has been studied for its probiotic potential in a number of
contexts. *L. gasseri*, first isolated from the human intestine, has been
demonstrated to establish in the GI tract when given as a probiotic
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11298228),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17116981)). This ability is
particularly advantageous, as probiotics typically have difficulties
establishing in the GI tract.

The potentially beneficial effects of *L. gasseri* are numerous. It binds
cholesterol ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10068945)), prevents
dextran sulfate-induced ulcerative colitis in rats
([ref](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bifidus1996/21/3/21_3_179/_article)),
and produces a bacteriocin ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9028050),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11129595)), a bacterial toxin that
could potentially be used as a weapon against closely related intestinal
pathogens.

A 2010 study ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20216555)) demonstrated
that probiotic treatment with *L. gasseri* of individuals with obese tendencies
was followed by reduced abdominal adiposity, body weight, BMI, and waist and
hip measurements, indicating that *L. gasseri* could be used as a probiotic in
some to prevent obesity in at-risk individuals. Furthermore, a 2001 study ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11328791))
demonstrated that *L. gasseri* treatment of individuals with *Helicobacter pylori*
suppressed *H. pylori* and reduced gastric inflammation. These studies suggest
that the probiotic potential of *L. gasseri* could be quite large, though more
studies are needed to fully characterize its probiotic potential and how
different individuals respond to treatment with this probiotic strain.

#### 2. *Methanobrevibacter smithii*

*Methanobrevibacter smithii* (*M. smithii*) is an archaeon, not a bacterium, and
has been observed as the predominant archaeon in the human gut.  It is a
methanogen, meaning that it produces methane (one of the gases in flatus)
as a metabolic byproduct in low-oxygen conditions; additionally, it removes
excess hydrogen from the gut (including the hydrogen in methane) and thus
increases the efficiency of energy extraction from nutrients
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774074)). *M. smithii* has been
observed in human feces for decades
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/4881707),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7065811)).  *M. smithii* is one of several
methane producers that might be found in human
feces.  Initial estimates determined that only about one-third of adults harbor
methane producers in the gut, and that the amounts of methane produced varies
by individual ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/5111441),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/70691),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/6902964)).

Because *M. smithii* consumes hydrogen in the gut, this places the microbe in the
unique position of being potentially beneficial to human gut health.  Accumulation of
hydrogen decreases the efficiency of microbial fermentation, which is involved
in polysaccharide digestion (a process human cells cannot perform); therefore,
*M. smithii* can aid in microbial fermentation (and polysaccharide digestion) by
removing the fermentation-inhibiting hydrogen.  Additionally, it also removes
fermentation end-products ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17563350)).

Interestingly, a 2011 study published in the International Journal of Obesity
revealed that obesity-associated gut microbiota were depleted in *M. smithii*,
while a 2009 PLoS One study noted that levels of *M. smithii* were increased in
anorexic patients compared to normal-weight controls
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19774074)).  These results appear to
be related to *M. smithii*'s use of nutrients in the human gut; however, the
results are still preliminary and more work is needed to confirm or refute *M.
smithii*'s exact role as a member of the gut microbiome.  Regardless, one thing
is clear: *M. smithii* is not an insignificant stand-by member of the gut
microbiome and likely plays an important role in nutrition and
energy harvest.

#### 3. *Roseburia intestinalis*

Like many species on this list, *Roseburia intestinalis* was first isolated from
human feces.  *R. intestinalis* produces butyrate via fermentation of dietary
plant-derived polysaccharides such as xylan
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12361264),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20105245)), a molecule that plays a
very important role in intestinal health. Not only does butyrate represent an
energy source for intestinal epithelial cells
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21531334)), but it is also capable of
counteracting inflammation-mediated ulcerative colitis and colorectal cancer
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14747692)) through its ability to
suppress colonic inflammation
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22517765)).

Because of butyrate's positive effects on GI tract health, bacterial species
that produce butyrate, such as *R. intestinalis*, are likely important players in
maintaining intestinal health. *R. intestinalis* is not as well characterized as
other members of the gut microbiome, but a recent study demonstrated that *R.
intestinalis* abundances were lower in type 2 diabetes patients
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24833634)). Additionally, a study in
India indicated that *R. intestinalis* abundance was decreased in ulcerative
colitis patients with more severe disease
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23801832)). Consistent with that
finding, butyrate was also significantly decreased in those patients.

#### 4. *Roseburia inulinivorans*

*Roseburia inulininovorans*, a close relative of *R. intestinalis*, was also first
isolated from human feces. Like *R. intestinalis*, *R. inulinivorans* also produces
butyrate, but it does so by degrading the plant polysaccharides starch and
inulin and the sugar fucose instead of xylan
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17397470)). In addition to butyrate,
*R. intestinalis* can also produce propionate. Like butyrate, propionate can
increase host health, although its action is not focused on the gut epithelium.
It is thought to decrease lipogenesis (the conversion of simple sugars to fatty
acids), serum cholesterol levels, and carcinogenesis (the transformation of
normal cells into cancer cells)
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21521227)). *R. inulinivorans* is
therefore a potentially important player in maintaining host health in multiple
ways-both via butyrate and via propionate. However, because *R. inulinivorans*
has only been recently described, no specific work describing its impact on
human health or disease has been published to date.

#### 5. *Akkermansia muciniphila*

*Akkermansia muciniphila* is known for its ability to degrade mucin, a protein
produced by epithelial tissues that forms gels. The ability to form gels
means mucin can serve a number of functions, from lubrication to forming
chemical barriers ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17950376)).  *A.
muciniphila* is a common member of the human gastrointestinal tract
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18083887)), and is even present in
infants as well as adults, though its abundance decreases in elderly
individuals ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17933936)). It appears to
play an important role in gut barrier integrity and favorable modulation of the
mucosal immune response ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21904534)).
Interestingly, *A. muciniphila* was reported to be decreased in autism
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21784919)), a disorder associated
with a range of gastrointestinal disorders.

A number of research groups have focused on the association between *A.
muciniphila* and diabetes and obesity. In both humans and in animal models, *A.
muciniphila* abundance decreases as host weight increases. An elegant 2012 study
demonstrated that in obese diabetic mice (type 2 diabetes;
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23671105)). *A. muciniphila* was
decreased; however, treatment of these mice with *A. muciniphila* reversed
high-fat diet induced metabolic disorders, including insulin resistance.
Treatment was also associated with increased intestinal levels of molecules
called endocannabinoids, which control inflammation and gut barrier integrity.

Although much work is yet to be done, the evidence points to an important role
for *A. muciniphila* in gut barrier integrity, with likely associations between
decreased levels of *A. muciniphila* and diseases such as obesity and diabetes.
It is important to remember that whether this decrease in *A. muciniphila* is
simply a result of the disease or whether it actually plays an active role in
the disease process is unknown.

#### 6. *Prevotella copri*

*Prevotella copri* is another intestinal microbe, but unlike some of the others
discussed here, it doesn't have any known or presumed roles in maintaining
human health. In fact, the opposite appears to be the case. *P. copri* is most
famous for its alleged connection to rheumatoid arthritis, an accusation that
was first presented in 2013 when a research group found that *P. copri* was
strongly correlated with disease in patients with new-onset rheumatoid
arthritis ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24192039)). This group also
identified unique *Prevotella* genes that also correlated with disease, and when
they colonized mice with *P. copri*, the mice became more susceptible to
chemical-induced colitis. Although exciting, this study is preliminary and the
first to suggest a connection between *P. copri* and arthritis. More work needs
to be done to determine whether *P. copri* is associated with inflammation in
this autoimmune disease or not, and before we brand *P. copri* as a "bad" or
"good" player in human health. This cautionary statement is especially
underscored when we take into account that in the same year in which *P. copri*
was suspected to be connected to rheumatoid arthritis, a second research group
determined that *P. copri* related species are decreased in the gut microbiomes
of autistic children ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23844187)).

#### 7. *Bifidobacterium breve*

Like *Lactobacillus gasseri*, *Bifidobacterium breve* is often used as a probiotic;
however, most studies in humans have been done on infants, rather than adults.
Several studies have demonstrated beneficial, anti-inflammatory properties
possessed by *B. breve*. Treatment with *B. breve* combined with other probiotic
species or carbohydrate molecules reduces inflammation in animal models of
asthma ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24735374),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24440361)), and significantly reduces
the risk of developing atopic dermatitis, the development of asthma symptoms,
and allergic markers in infants
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25056226),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21081959),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20560907)).  

The beneficial effects observed in the studies referenced above are likely due
to the purported ability of *B. breve* to positively influence the immune system.
By adding *B. breve*-produced proteins to cells in the laboratory, investigators
were able to determine that *B. breve* not only accelerated Peyer's patch cell
proliferation, but also enhanced antibody (B cell) production
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1860970)). Additionally, *B. breve*
induced dendritic cell maturation, activation, and survival, and inhibited the
negative effects of bacterial lipopolysaccharide on these immune cells
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16522473)). Additionally, *B. breve*
significantly reduced GI tract expression of inflammatory genes in newborn rat
pups ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22289850)).

#### 8. *Eubacterium eligens*

Although *Eubacterium* are often isolated from human feces, not much is known
about these bacteria. Like many other species in this list, *E. eligens* is
capable of fermenting several plant polysaccharides
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/563214)), and the *Eubacterium* genus
in general produces GI-tract health-promoting butyrate
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12480096),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17189447)). However, no specific
studies thoroughly analyzing the potential beneficial (or harmful) actions of
*E. eligens* have been published to date. A related species, *Eubacterium
aerofaciens*, has been shown to be closely associated with a low risk for colon
cancer ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7574628)), while the genus
*Eubacterium* was significantly decreased in children born to obese mothers than
those born to normal-weight mothers
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25409177)), and in another study was
also more abundant in normal-weight individuals compared to overweight
individuals ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25202708)). Therefore, it
seems as though *Eubacterium* may have a beneficial role in human health, but the
existence of so few studies illustrates the need for a focused research effort
to fully characterize the role of not only *E. eligens* but other *Eubacterium*
species.

#### 9. *Eubacterium rectale*

*Eubacterium rectale* is a close relative to *E. eligens*, and as such, little
research has been done on this member of the *Eubacterium* genus. As mentioned
above, some preliminary work suggests that *Eubacterium* may play a beneficial
role in human health, though much work is still needed to fully characterize
the role of *Eubacterium spp.* in health and disease. As described above, studies
have indicated that the genus *Eubacterium* is positively associated with a
healthy weight; a 2008 study determined that *E. rectale* increased in
individuals on a weight loss diet compared to those on a weight-maintenance
diet ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18779823)). Studies have also
shown that *E. rectale* is decreased in patients with ulcerative colitis
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/220292917)) and additionally is not a
major member of bacterial biofilms in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) patients
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000463)).  Interestingly, *E.
rectale* was a major member of bacterial biofilms in inflammatory bowel syndrome
(IBS) patients ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16000463)).

#### 10. *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii*

Like *Roseburia spp.*, *Faecalibacterium prausnitzii* is an important butyrate
producer in the human GI tract. Numerous studies have described associations
between *F. prausnitzii* and health and several disease states, solidly
establishing this species as an importer player in maintaining host health.

Much work has been focused on the association between the presence or absence
of *F. prausnitzii* in the gut microbiome and gut diseases, and a wealth of
evidence suggests that *F. prausnitzii* promotes gut health in a number of
contexts. Lower abundances of *F. prausnitzii* have been observed in IBD
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24799893)) and infectious colitis
patients ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19235886)) as well as
Crohn's disease patients ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18936492))
and ulcerative colitis patients
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24021287)). In several animal models
of colitis, *F. prausnitzii* exerts a number of beneficial anti-inflammatory
effects ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25275569),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18936492),
[ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23643066)).  Beneficial effects have
also been observed in humans, with colonization with *F. prausnitzii* associated
with the maintenance of clinical remission in ulcerative colitis patients
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23725320)). Additionally, immune
cells that are induced by *F. prausnitzii*, are deficient in IBD patients
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24714039)).
