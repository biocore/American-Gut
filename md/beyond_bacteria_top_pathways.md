### Top Metabolic Pathways in the Beyond Bacteria Cohort

The whole-genome shotgun sequencing protocol used for the Beyond Bacteria
samples can be used to provide insight into potential molecular pathways, or
the functional potential, of a sample. The basic idea is to compare the
sequencing fragments produced to existing characterized reference databases in
order to identify what genes are likely present. Sometimes just knowing
specific genes is informative. However, much of the biochemical processes
contained in your gut (and in your own body) are the result of complex networks
of gene interactions known as pathways. Once we know what genes are present in
a sample, we can begin to ask whether there are any combinations of genes (from
within the same organism) that can be combined together into existing known
molecular pathways. It is these pathways that provide for the production of
vitamins, essential proteins, and many other processes critical not just for
the life of the individual organism, but also for the health and well-being of
the human in which the organism lives.

One of the common interactions between hosts and their microbial symbionts is
the exchange of chemicals. Hosts can contribute molecules to this exchange
through their diets. Microbes are also able to modify host molecules. In
return, the microbiome produces molecules that the host would otherwise not be
able to use. For example, the human genome encodes less than twenty enzymes
capable of breaking down complex sugars. In contrast, an assembled metagenomic
library of 104 organisms encoded more than 15,000 enzymes for digesting these
sugars ([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23748339)). Other metabolites
produced by the microbiome that influence host health include the following:
serotonin, with 95% of the body's supply made by gut bacteria; short-chain
fatty acids, which regulate metabolism and brain function; and trimethylamine
N-oxide (TMAO), which plays a role in the development of cardiovascular disease
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25440054)).

Although microbes contribute many functions, human hosts and their microbes
share common molecular mechanisms. Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) store and
communicate the function of the cell by determining what proteins can be made.
To reproduce, cells need a way to make more DNA. They also need ways to repair
DNA if it gets damaged. Proteins are required to carry out many cellular
functions. They serve primarily as enzymes, which make the reactions necessary
for life fast enough to make them practical. However, proteins are also
involved in the structure of the cell, movement, and communication both within
and outside the cell.  Lipids provide a structure and may also send signals
inside the cell. Sugars are useful for storing energy and may be modified to
help intracellular communication. Small molecules and cofactors are used for
communication. All of these necessary macromolecules are built from smaller
units. DNA and RNA chains are built from single nucleotide units. Proteins are
made up of amino acids. Membrane lipids are typically triglycerides, made of
carboxylic acids connected by a bridge molecule. And, long chain
polysaccharides are made of single sugars. 

Building and breakdown the molecular components of the cell requires energy.
Energy is typically released when bonds are broken, like during carbohydrate
metabolism, and consumed when bonds are made, such as during nucleotide
synthesis.  Two of the primary ways cells transfer energy are through
oxidation/reduction (redox) intermediates and through phosphate bonds.
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD or NADP) is a common is a common redox
electron carrier. In its oxidized form, it can accept two electrons and a
proton (H+). This can then be carried to a reaction where the electrons are
needed, and be used to reduce another molecule. High-energy phosphate bonds are
also used to store energy, like a battery. It takes energy to combine phosphate
groups together, since they contain negatively charged oxygens that like to
repel each other. When the bond between two phosphate groups is broken, the
energy of keeping the oxygens together can be donated to another reaction. The
most common way to find these phosphate bonds is in the form of
adenosine-triphosphate (ATP).

The metagenomic pathways found within the human gut are a predictor of the
metabolic intermediates which will be found there
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25440054)). Some pathways provide
unique functions to the host, while others are required for the maintenance of
cellular life. We've described the most abundant pathways found in the Beyond
Bacteria cohort, as well as a few pathways of interest which provide molecules
you could not otherwise synthesize. 

#### Carbon Fixation					

Carbon is the molecular backbone of life, and all of the carbon in organisms
was at one point carbon dioxide.  That carbon dioxide becomes organic carbon
(sugars, lipids, proteins, and other molecules) via a process called carbon
fixation.  Most of the organic carbon that we eat comes from carbon fixation
done by plants; either we eat those plants directly, or we eat animal products
that got their energy-rich carbon from plants.  By extension, most of the
microbes in our guts get their organic carbon from what we eat; however, some
of them can instead synthesize organic carbon via their own carbon fixation
pathways. In total, six kinds of carbon fixation have been identified in
nature. The pathway that fixes carbon in green plants (the Calvin cycle), and
therefore most of our food, is not found in our gut bacteria, but two other
pathways are.

The reductive citrate cycle (also called the Arnon-Buchanan cycle) is a
low-energy alternative to the Calvin cycle found in some Proteobacteria and a
few other lineages. Its enzymes are sensitive to oxygen, and therefore it is
found only in the anaerobic or microaerophilic regions of the gut. The
dicarboxylate-hydroxybutyrate cycle is found in the crenarchaeota
Thermoproteales and Desulfurococcales (orders of archaea, not bacteria). These
archaea are also anaerobic. Thus, these two major pathways of carbon fixation
require low-oxygen conditions, which describes the majority of the human gut.

#### Carbon Metabolism

As most of the organic carbon required by gut bacteria comes from the food we
eat, pathways for utilizing high-energy carbon compounds are highly represented
in the gut metagenomic data. Core functions for breaking down sugar for energy
are represented in the carbon metabolism genes in the Beyond Bacteria
metagenomes.

Glycolysis (also called the Embden-Meyerhof pathway), including the part
involving three-carbon compounds, is the central pathway in heterotrophic
metabolism (breakdown of organic carbon for energy). It is found in diverse
organisms, from E. coli to yeast to humans. Glycolysis (literally "breakdown of
glucose") is the conversion of one molecule of glucose into two molecules for
pyruvate (a three-carbon compound), with two molecules each of NADH and ATP
generated as by-products. Gluconeogenesis is essentially the reverse of
glycolysis, converting two three-carbon compounds like pyruvate back into
glucose. Why would a cell want to do both? This gives the cell flexibility to
break down carbon stores to make ATP (a mode of metabolism called catabolism)
or make biomass to grow using available energy (called anabolism). Using many
of the same reactions, a cell can shift its metabolism in either direction
depending on its needs.

The citrate cycle (also called the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle or Krebs
cycle) is the next step of energy production after glycolysis. First, pyruvate
is converted to acetyl-CoA, which then feeds into the citrate cycle, where it
is converted into three molecules of NADH, one molecule of GTP (similar to
ATP), and two molecules of carbon dioxide. The NADH produced here (and in
glycolysis) is really important, because it can be used to make much more ATP.
Using a large membrane-bound complex called the electron transport chain, the
electrons stored in NADH are passed from donor molecules to acceptor molecules,
generating a gradient of protons (H+), with the electrons eventually accepted
by oxygen to form water. The proton gradient is used to power the synthesis of
ATP. Because oxygen is such a good electron acceptor, a lot of ATP can be made.
Of course, since much of the gut is anaerobic, other less-efficient terminal
electron acceptors have to be used. Compounds like fumarate, nitrate, and
nitrite can all serve as final electron acceptors if oxygen isn't available. If
all of this sounds complicated, that's because it is; scientists still don't
understand how parts of the process work!

The serine pathway for formaldehyde assimilation is found in methanotrophic
("methane eating") bacteria. It is one of two ways for these bacteria to
assimilate formaldehyde, produced from the oxidation of methane and methanol,
into biosynthetic pathways. In other words, methanotrophs consume one-carbon
methane or methanol to make energy, but rather than throw away the product
(formaldehyde), they incorporate it into their cellular building blocks.

#### Nucleotide Synthesis

Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. DNA, of course, is the code
or blueprint for making an organism, providing the instructions for making all
the proteins in a cell. RNA is the molecule that takes those instructions and
makes the proteins, fulfilling a variety of roles in the process. The
structures of DNA and RNA nucleotides are very similar. The main difference is
that deoxyribonucleotides (as in deoxyribonucleic acid, DNA) have just a proton
(H+) on a particular part of the sugar, whereas ribonucleotides (as in
ribonucleic acid, RNA) have an -OH group there. The other difference is that
the two molecules use slightly different nitrogenous bases to encode their
messages. DNA uses the famous ACGT bases: adenine, cytosine, guanine, and
thymine. RNA uses, instead of thymine, uracil (U). The bases are grouped into
two categories based on their structures: purines (adenine, guanine) and
pyrimidines (cytosine, thymine, uracil). The base-pairing in DNA and RNA
generally follows these rules: A pairs with T (or U), and C pairs with G.

The pathways pyrimidine deoxyribonuleotide biosynthesis and pyrimidine
ribonucleotide biosynthesis are, as their names suggest, involved in the
synthesis of both DNA and RNA versions of cytosine, thymine, and uracil. The
names change slightly when they are attached to a sugar (deoxyribose or
ribose): cytidine, thymidine, and uridine. Hence, uridine monophosphate
biosynthesis is the synthesis of a nucleotide with a uracil base, ribose sugar,
and single phosphate molecule. Nucleotides can be either monophosphate,
diphosphate, or triphosphate (think ATP), each one progressively more
energy-rich. Based on our discussion here, Guanine ribonucleotide biosynthesis
should be pretty self-explanatory. Inosine monophosphate biosynthesis produces
a nucleotide found in certain types of RNA called transfer RNA. Inosine is
interesting in that it can form so-called non-Watson-Crick base pairs; inosine
can pair with cytosine, uracil, and adenine. Inosine can also be converted to
guanine and adenosine.

Finally, it's not surprising that pathways for nucleotide synthesis are highly
represented in human gut metagenomes. There generally isn't enough DNA or RNA
in the food we eat to supply the nucleotide requirements for bacteria, and
transporting them across membranes is difficult. Therefore, they need to
synthesize most of their nucleotides de novo (from scratch).

#### Amino Acid Metabolism

Amino acids are the building blocks of proteins, just like nucleotides are the
building blocks of DNA and RNA. Proteins are built from a combination of 20
different amino acids, each with different chemical properties that give
proteins an amazing diversity of three-dimensional shapes and functions. Not
all organisms can make all 20 amino acids. For example, humans can make only 11
of the 20; the other 9 are called "essential" amino acids because they must be
consumed as part of our food. Bacteria generally are able to make more amino
acids than humans.

For gut bacteria, amino acids in our diet are an important source of food. Gut
bacteria can ferment (degrade) amino acids, obtaining energy and carbon. This
fermentation of dietary amino acids has significant effects on host gut health
and beyond. The products of amino acid breakdown affect host immunity and cell
function, and also feed back on microbial composition and metabolism
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21196263)).

The amino acid pathways most abundant in the Beyond Bacteria cohort were
cysteine biosynthesis, methionine degradation, and methionine salvage.
Methionine is an essential amino acid, meaning it's required from our diet.
These pathways indicate methionine in our gut is consumed (salvaged) by
bacteria and also degraded, likely to make energy, other amino acids, or to
harvest nitrogen or sulfur. Cysteine is not an essential amino acid, as humans
can synthesize it. However, the sulfur in our cysteine comes from methionine.
Therefore, it's possible that methionine degradation by the microbiome is
contributing to cysteine biosynthesis, either used by the bacteria or harvested
by the host (you!). What's clear is that both bacteria and humans need a full
suite of 20 amino acids to make functional proteins, which do almost all the
major functions in cells, and also that bacteria use dietary amino acids for
food. There is an intricate interplay between microbiome, host, and diet in the
synthesis and breakdown of amino acids.
	
#### Vitamin Synthesis

The most common vitamin production pathway in the human gut metagenome is
folate synthesis. Tetrahydrofolate (the basic form of tetrahydrofolic acid), is
also known as B9. Tetrahydrofolate is necessary for DNA repair and synthesis.
Low tetrahydrofolate levels can lead to anemia, and there is some evidence that
folic acid may be involved in depression
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25644193)). Two pathways involving
tetrahydrofolate were identified in the Beyond Bacteria samples: the synthesis
of tetrahydrofolate from GTP and C1-unit interconversion by prokaryotes. 

The first pathway is less abundant, and converts a guanine-nucleotide
triphosphate, L-guanine, and a molecule of aminobenzoate to a molecule of
tetrahydrofolate (Schema 1). Tetrahydrofolate is biologically available.

#### schema 1, insert figure Schema 1. Molecular components of tetrahydrofolate
biosynthesis.

The C1-interconversion pathway utilizes tetrahydrofolate to catalyze the
conversion of glycine to serine (Schema 2). This pathway uses energy in the
form of ATP to add a formate group first to the folate body and then transfer
it to the glycine. The transfer is able to regenerate tetrahydrofolate.

electrons to the reaction, and ATP provides energy.

### Low-Abundance Pathways of Interest
											
#### Other Vitamin Synthesis

Two other B-vitamins can be synthesized by the microbiome: Vitamin B12, called
Cobalamin, and Vitamin B5, or Pantothenate. Cobalamin is one of the most
complex "small molecules" utilized by the body. It is involved in DNA
synthesis, fatty acid metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. It is critical to
neurological function and red blood cell formation. The structure of Cobalamin
is unique among vitamins. It consists of a ring made out of interconnected
planner carbons and nitrogens. The creates a binding pocket in the center of
the molecule which is able to capture a Cobalt (I) ion. The captured cobalt ion
means that cobalamin can bind negatively charged molecules above and below the
plane of the cobalamin ring, which creates an important chemical interface.

Cobalamin is synthesized in four steps
([ref](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11215515)). First, eight glutamates
are combined to create the aromatic ring structure called Precorrin-2 (Schema
3). This is a general pathway used in Heme Biosynthesis (M00121). To make a
form of heme, precorrin-2 would gain an Iron (II) ion at its center. For
vitamin B12 Precorrin-2 is converted to cobamaide. Cobamaide, among other
modifications, gains a Cobalt ion at its center. Cobamide is converted to
Cob(I)yrinate diamide, which enters the cobalamine pathway found in the
American Gut (M00121). This pathway converts Cob(I)yrinate diamide to cobalamin
using dimethylbenzimadizole and ATP-energy. The cobalamin can then be utilized
within the bacteria, or shared with their host. 

#### schema 3, insert figure Schema 3. Precorrin-2 biosynthesis from Glutamate

Pantothenate is required for the synthesis of the co-enzyme, Acetyl CoA. Acetyl
CoA is critical for carbon metabolism and fixation, as well as aiding fatty
acid synthesis. Pantothenate is a long-chain of carbons which is synthesized
from valine, a form of the amino acid alanine where the molecules have been
rearranged called 3-amino-propionate, and 2-ketogluterate, which is converted
to 2-ketovaline and Pantothenate. The five step processes uses a form of
tetrahydrofolate, 5,10-methylenetetrahydrofolate which transfers one carbon
into the creation, an electron donor, and ATP for energy (Schema 4).

#### schema 4, insert figure Schema 4: Pantothenate Synthesis. THF is an
abbreviation for Tetrahydrofolate. NADP+/NADPH are an oxidation/reduction pair
which donate electrons to the reaction. ATP stores energy.
