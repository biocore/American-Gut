Data
====

OTU Tables and QIIME-compliant mapping files used to generate figures and statistics for the American Gut project. All data are de-identified.

Data sources
------------

The following studies are being used to provide context for the American Gut data:

* [Human Microbiome Project](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699609), v35 reads. The sequence data were generated using 454 instruments.
* [Global Gut](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699611). The sequence data were generated using HiSeq instruments.
* [Personal Genome Project](http://personalgenomes.org) microbiome samples, unpublished. The sequence data were generated using MiSeq instruments.

Data prefixes
-------------

Each study used is described by an acronym:

* AG, American Gut
* HMP, Human Microbiome Project
* GG, Global Gut
* PGP, Personal Genome Project

File tags
---------

The provided [BIOM](http://biom-format.org) tables have a few different tags in the filenames to describe the included data.

* 100nt - The sequences were trimmed to 100 nucleotides prior to OTU picking
* even1k - The full table was rarified to 1000 sequences per sample
* even10k - The full table was rarified to 10000 sequences per sample

The trimming is necessary when combining data from studies in which different sequences technologies were used (e.g., HiSeq vs. MiSeq).
