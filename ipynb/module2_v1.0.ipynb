      "The purpose of this notebook is to perform a complete analysis of the microbial community data for samples in the American Gut dataset. The notebook will produce as output one summary PDF for each fecal sample in American Gut. The notebook integrates the microbiome data from the American Gut Project, the [Human Microbiome Project](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699609), the [Global Gut Project](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699611), and the unpublished [Personal Genome Project](http://personalgenomes.org/). More information about the American Gut Project can be found [here](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699611).\n",
      "\n",
      "Essentially, this notebook provides an open-source recipe for all the results processing, so that independent scientists (as well as scientists involved in the project) can check every step, reproduce the results themselves, and make suggestions for improvements. If you have the appropriate computing infrastructure you can also run everything yourself; in future, we plan to make a version available on EC2 so anyone can use it without setting up their own cluster, but some additional software development will be required and we wanted to get the current version in the hands of the community sooner.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Gut Project is part of the [Earth Microbiome Project](http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/) and follows the same protocols and data release standards put forth by the EMP. The project is run primarily through the [Knight Lab](http://www.earthmicrobiome.org/) in the [BioFrontiers Institute](http://biofrontiers.colorado.edu/) at the [University of Colorado at Boulder](http://colorado.edu).\n",
      "\n",
      "Over [50 people](https://github.com/biocore/American-Gut/blob/master/CREDITS.md) have volunteered their time to support this project. These volunteers have played roles from sending thousands of samples to thousands of participants all over the world, to developing complex web and database infrastructures, to developing new analysis techniques and procedures, to responding to the questions from our participants. This project would not be possible without the unified effort of so many dedicated people.\n",

      "This Notebook assumes the following resources are available:\n",

[Michael Pollan](http://michaelpollan.com/) was one of the first participants in the project and has given us permission to use his data as a reference.\n",
      "* A table detailing specific operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the sample that differ significantly from the rest of the American Gut population in their relative abundance.\n",
      "\n",
      "Below are the major steps this notebook will take:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. Download the American Gut data and metadata from the European Bioinformatics Institute ([EBI](http://www.ebi.ac.uk/)), which is part of International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration ([INSDC](http://www.insdc.org/)).\n",
      "2. Filter gammaproteobacterial OTUs (using multiple rounds of OTU picking) that exhibit inflated abundances due to blooms introduced before sample receipt at CU Boulder. See [here](http://americangut.org/?page_id=202) for further detail. \n",
      "3. Determine OTUs at 97% sequence identity (taxonomic resolution typically corresponding approximately to species-level assignments) by clustering against [Greengenes](http://greengenes.secondgenome.com) version 13_5.\n",
      "4. Trim sequences to 100 nucleotides in order to permit valid comparisons with other studies that provide pre-trimmed data, thus avoiding sequence length biases in OTU assignment.\n",
      "5. Merge the American Gut OTUs with the OTUs from the [Human Microbiome Project](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699609), the [Global Gut](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22699611), and the [Personal Genome Project](http://personalgenomes.org/) microbiome data based on assigned taxonomy.\n",
      "6. Merge the sample metadata from all studies, which contains information on the study variables that describe each sample.\n",
      "7. Rarefy samples to 1000 sequences per sample (due to the relatively low coverage in the Human Microbiome Project) to normalize for differential sequencing depth.\n",
      "8. Compute beta diversity using unweighted [UniFrac](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16332807).\n",
      "9. Compute principal coordinates using unweighted UniFrac distances and visualize using [Emperor](http://www.gigasciencejournal.com/content/2/1/16/).\n",
      "10. Build phylum level taxonomy summaries comparing each sample to similar groups (e.g., age, BMI, etc), and to [Michael Pollan](http://michaelpollan.com/).\n",
      "11. Determine abundant and enriched microbes within each sample relative to the American Gut population.\n",
      "12. Produce the full taxonomy summary for each sample using unrarefied data.\n",
      "13. Populate the results template (additional information about the results can be found here) to produce graphics and a frameable set of results.\n",
      "14. Produce a summary of the project.\n",
