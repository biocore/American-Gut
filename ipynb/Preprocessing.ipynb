    "A **metadata file**, sometimes called a **mapping file**, provides information about our samples which cannot be determined from 16S marker gene sequences alone. Metadata is as important as the bacterial sequence information for determining information about the microbiome. Metadata tells us information about the sample, such as the body site where it was collected, the participant’s age or whether or not they have certain diseases. Since these can make a very large difference in the microbiome, it’s important to have this information!\n",

    "American Gut metadata is collected through the participant survey. The survey allows participants to skip any question they do not wish to answer, meaning that some samples are missing fields. The python library used to handle metadata in these notebooks will specially encode these fields. Within IPython analysis notebooks, missing data will be represented as a Numpy `NaN`. Printed notebooks are set return empty spaces for missing values, although this can be changed by altering the [write_na](#Metadata-and-text-file-handling-parameters) variable. For certain QIIME scripts, leaving these fields blank will allow the script to ignore samples missing metadata.\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Gut metadata is also de-identified. This means the metadata does not contain information which could be used to identify a participant, like their name, email address, or the kit ID. Instead, each participant is assigned a code. This allows us to identify multiple samples from the same individual. The samples are identified by the barcode number, which appears on the sample tube. This number connects the survey metadata to the sample data in the OTU table and distance matrix.\n",

We use these as stand-ins for bacterial groups. More information about OTUs, the level of similarity used, and the methods we use to generate OTUs can be found in the [Primary Processing Pipeline Notebook](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/biocore/American-Gut/blob/master/ipynb/module2_v1.0.ipynb). \n",

Unlike the other file types we will generate here, Biom files cannot be viewed using a normal spreadsheet program on your computer. The benefit of Biom format is that it allows us to save large amounts of data in a smaller amount of space. Biom data may be encoded as a JSON string, or using the same HDF5 compression NASA does.

The microbiome of very young children is not yet stable, and differs greatly from that of adults  [<a href=\"#20668239\">12</a>, <a href=\"#22699611\">13</a>]. Additionally, BMI limits are not easily assigned in people who are still growing. Without stratifying by gender, we assumed that growth will be complete in most people by the age of 20, and set our limit there. The limit at seventy was based on the number of individuals over that age, and on differences in the microbiome seen in older individuals [<a href=\"#20571116\">14</a>, <a href=\"#22797518\">15</a>].\n",

It has been suggested that obesity changes the gut microbiome, although the effect is not consistent across all studies [<a href=\"#25307765\">16</a>]. Additionally, we noticed that there were also alterations in our sample of underweight individuals.\n",

    "We will use our rarefaction tables to calculate the alpha diversity associated with each rarefaction.  Alpha diversity is a measure of intra sample diversity. Imagine that we could put up an imaginary wall around a 100ft x 100ft x 10 ft box in Yellowstone National Park, trapping all the vertebrate animals in that area for a short period of time. Imagine that we then made a very careful list (or took photographs) of the area so that we could document all the life we found in the area. We could count all the different types of animals we found in that area. This would be one measure of alpha diversity. \n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of than just considering each type of animal to be equally similar, we wanted to include an evolutionary relationship between the animals. So, if our area contained a mouse, a squirrel and a rabbit, we might say these animals are more similar (and therefore less diverse) than if we found a mouse, a squirrel, and a sagebrush lizard in the same area. So, even though we’ve found three species in each case, the third species being a reptile would make it more diverse than the third species being a rodent. \n",
    "\n",
    "A diversity metric which accounts for shared evolutionary history between species is called a phylogenetic metric. This often uses a phylogenetic tree to provide information about that shared history. PD Whole Tree Diversity is a commonly used phylogenetic alpha diversity metric in microbiome research [<a href=\"#15831718\">8</a>]. A taxonomic metric assumes all species are equally different. Common taxonomic metrics for alpha diversity used  in microbiome research include Observed Species Diversity and Chao1 Diversity [<a href=\"#Chao\">9</a>, <a href=\"#shannon\">10</a>].\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on what information we’re looking for, we might want to include information about the number of each animal belonging to the species we see. We might also want to consider the number of each different species we find in the area, weighting our diversity. So, if in our little area of Yellowstone, 90% of the animals we see are mice, while 5% are rabbits and 5% are trout, we would consider this less diverse than if 40% of the animals were mice, 30% were rabbits and 30% were trout. A metric which takes into account the counts of each species is a quantitative metric, while a qualitative metric looks only at the presence or absence of a species.\n",
    "\n",
    "While alpha diversity is calculated completely independently for each sample, the comparison of alpha diversity may provide clues about environmental changes. For example, pollution or an algal bloom may be associated with lower alpha diversity, and indicate a potential change in the health of the ecosystem.\n",
    "We’ll start our work with alpha diversity by calculating the diversity for our rarefied American Gut tables using the four metrics we selected in the alpha diversity parameters: the phylogenetic PD whole Tree Diversity, and the taxonomic metrics, Observed Species Diversity, Chao1 Diversity and Shannon Diversity. All the diversity metrics we are using here are qualitative metrics."
