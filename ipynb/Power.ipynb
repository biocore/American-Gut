      "While null hypothesis statistical testing demonstrates if something has an effect, effect sizes allow the estimation of how important that effect is. There have been many calls in medical literature for the inclusion of effect size along with statistical p values, as they increase the power of comparison [<a href=\"#17944619\">1</a>,<a href=\"#23997866\">2</a>]. We can leverage effect sizes within microbiome research in multiple ways. Understanding the effect size may help us rank which factors affect the microbiome the most. This, in turn, could help identify targets for intervention. Effect size can also help us design better studies. In the context of statistical power, effect size can help us estimate how many samples we might need to be reasonably confident that our data is true, given some margin of error.\n",
      "\n",
      "The complex relation between humans and their microbes, especially the microbes in their guts, has been recognized in many areas of human health. Our microbes are known to change during the course of our lives, although most of this change occurs within the first three years [<a href=\"#20668239\">3</a>-<a href=\"#22797518\">6</a>]. Long term dietary patterns also have a large influence on our gut microbiome, although certain extreme dietary changes can force a switch [<a href=\"#21596990\">7</a>-<a href=\"#24336217\">9</a>]. The gut microbiome can also be re-shaped by antibiotic use [<a href=\"#20736229\">10</a>-<a href=\"#25271726\">13</a>]. It\u2019s also known that the microbiome is altered in diseases. Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) and Obesity are well studied examples in which the disease state is associated with a dysbiosis, or altered community structure [<a href=\"#25307765\">14</a>-<a href=\"#24009397\">25</a>]. Seasonal changes in the microbiome have also been previously reported [<a href=\"#24618913\">26</a>]. We will demonstrate that in a healthy population of adults, age, alcohol consumption, exercise frequency and sleep duration also have impacts on the microbiome.\n",
      "\n",
      "The list of factors which interact with the microbiome is based on the results of significance testing, and does not consider effect size. But, effect size is still an important consideration in microbiome research for both experimental design and possible interventions. Using the American Gut data, we can demonstrate that antibiotic use in the past month significantly decreases alpha diversity, compared with people who have not used antibiotics in the past year (p < 0.01). We can also show that people who drink alcohol regularly (three or more times per week) have higher alpha diversity than those who do not consume alcohol (p < 0.01).\n",
      "\n",
      "If these results were published, one can imagine a situation in which popular media might advise the regular consumption of alcohol use following a dose of antibiotics to help repopulate the microbiome. If we ignore the number of logical fallacies associated with this practice, and instead assume that regular alcohol consumption is able to reseed the gut microbiome in a healthy way, the question then becomes if this will be an effective treatment. (Of course, this represents a potential example, and no real data beyond the significance exists to support this mechanistic hypothesis.) If the effect size of alcohol consumption is on the same order or greater than the effect of antibiotic use, than regular alcohol consumption following antibiotic use might be a good treatment strategy. On the other hand, if alcohol consumption has less effect than antibiotic use, the regular consumption of alcohol might not be worth the expense.\n",
      "\n",
      "The American Gut data set present a rare opportunity of effect size prediction within the microbiome field. The large size and high degree of heterogeneity among participants and amount of survey metadata collected from each participant allows the examination of effect size for factors that are either currently uncharacterized or under characterized in microbiome research. The accompanying challenge is that effect size calculations are difficult for the type of data collected in microbiome research. Most traditional effect size metrics for comparing samples between groups, such as Cohen\u2019s D, make assumptions about the normality of the data being studied, while microbiome data is not normal. As a result, we will leverage a method of empirically estimating statistical power.\n",

      "### Statistical Hypotheses and Error: A \"toy\" example\n",
      "Using statistics, we can test hypotheses. For example, we might want to test whether or not toy bricks costs different amounts depending on which model they come from. Perhaps we\u2019re trying to build the most epic toy brick set to represent places where the microbiome is studied. We\u2019re trying to do this in the cheapest way possible. We\u2019ve determined that there are two relatively inexpensive sets which contain a specific brick we want: a chemistry laboratory and a komodo dragon enclosure. However, we\u2019d also like to repurpose the rest of the bricks in the sets. So, we\u2019d like to consider the cost per brick when we purchase the sets.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, we\u2019re going to test the hypothesis that the cost per brick in the lab playset is different from the cost per brick in the komodo dragon playset. We can write two possible outcomes for our statistical test, and call them hypotheses:\n",
      "<center><strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: The model type is not related to the cost per brick.</center>\n",
      "$$cost_{lab} = cost_{dragon}$$\n",
      "<center><strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong>: The model type is related to the cost per brick.</center>\n",
      "$$cost_{lab} \\neq cost_{dragon}$$\n",
      "\n",
      "In an ideal world, we would be able to collect information about every set sold in the country, which statisticians would call the population. But, presumably, this is a side project, and we don\u2019t have enough time or energy to be able to collect information about every single toy brick set of a particular model sold at every single store in the country. \n",
      "\n",
      "Rather than collect information about every single set in the country, let\u2019s assume that we were able to collect price information for the three toys a week at three stores across the country during the calendar year, 2013. Let\u2019s call each time someone checked the price an \u201cobservation\u201d. The total set of observations of each model is a \u201csample\u201d. For each observation, we have the location, calendar date, and whether or not there was an advertised sale. Using population based data from the US census bureau, we can extrapolate more information about the community. Since we have a small number of observations at each point, we can trade resolution for sample number and pool the data about our models into assigned categories like **SEASON**, **DATE**, **REGION**, **COMMUNITY_TYPE**, **STORE** and **SALE**.\n",

In our toy example, this would be saying that the bricks within the two sets cost different amounts, when in fact, they have the same cost. In a medical context, this might mean saying that someone has cancer, when in fact, they are healthy. Statisticians try to limit the risk associated with False Positives by setting their critical value, called \u03b1, which is the acceptable probability that a False positive has happened. Statistical p values are compared to the value of \u03b1 to determine if the risk of a false positive is acceptable.\n",

Most effect size measures make assumptions about the distribution of the data (for example, Cohen\u2019s F is the power of an ANOVA, which assumes a normal distribution)[<a href=\"#Cohen\">27</a>,<a href=\"#Zar\">28</a>]. Unfortunately, most microbiome data violates one or more traditional assumptions. For example, many bacterial taxa are sparsely represented and therefore do not follow a normal distribution [<a href=\"#23284876\">29</a>]. One approach to overcome problems associated with non-normal distributions is to use permutations [<a href=\"#Bondini\">30</a>].

      "The empirical power calculation method in [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/0.2.2/generated/skbio.stats.power.html) is based on iteration. It works by matching pairs of observations based on a set of metadata categories. A number of observations (set using <strong><code>min_counts</code></strong>, <strong><code>max_counts</code></strong>, and <strong><code>counts_interval</code></strong>) are then drawn at random from this set of matched data, and a statistical test is performed. This is repeated a number of times (given by <strong><code>num_iter</code></strong>), and the fraction of samples below a critical value (<strong><code>p_crit</code></strong>) is calculated as the power at that sample depth. This is repeated several times to determine the empirical power with some degree of confidence.\n",

      "We can now focus on calculating power for the fecal samples. The scikit bio function we\u2019re using will draw fecal samples which are matched for the control categories we set earlier, but either belong to group 1 or group 2 in the category we\u2019re varying. If we\u2019re varying a category that is also a control category (for example, if we\u2019re looking at the power for IBD), this will be removed from the control categories. Once again, we have the option of saving, and then loading the analysis files, if necessary. In its current incarnation, this notebook can be run on a personal computer. However, running these two cells typically takes six to eight hours."

We expect between 80 and 95% of samples to be amplified, depending on the source. If samples are low biomass, difficult to obtain, or cannot be resequenced for some reason, technical replicates may be used to help correct for this sequencing failure.

      "From our empirical effect size estimations, we can being to rank effects on the microbiome. As demonstrated by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), body site has the largest effect on the human microbiome [<a href=\"#22699609\">31</a>].\n",
      "\n",
      "We find that an IBD diagnosis has one of the largest impacts on the gut microbiome. While dysbiosis in IBD is likely a complex relationship between the host genetics, host lifestyle and the microbiome, the disease is characterized by a profoundly altered microbiome and intestinal inflammation [<a href=\"#25307765\">14</a>-<a href=\"#25567118\">20</a>]. As with IBD, the microbiome is considered strong predictive of obesity [<a href=\"#19043404\">21</a>-<a href=\"#24009397\">25</a>]. However, we find the effect of obesity on the microbiome is smaller than lifestyle factors like sleep and exercise for both alpha and beta diversity. This finding is corroborated, to some degree, by a recent meta analysis which found IBD-related microbial signatures to be consistent across studies while obesity-related dysbiosis was more strong influence by technical effects [<a href=\"#25307765\">14</a>].\n",
      "\n",
      "We might have predicted the difference in magnitude of these effects based gut pathology. IBD has been recognized as a disease of the intestines and a diagnosis is based on intestinal pathology [<a href=\"#19653289\">35</a>,<a href=\"#21530745\">36</a>]. In contrast, a diagnosis of obesity cannot be made by looking at the gut alone. It\u2019s likely the complex interactions of IBD-specific bacteria and bacterial strains along with host inflammation shapes the community structure in a unique way. It seems less likely we will see such a strong disease-associated effect in conditions that do not traditionally have gut involvement. It might be more reasonable to expect they will have an effect size closer to obesity.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also find that antibiotic use has a large effect on both alpha and beta diversity. This has been previously recognized [<a href=\"#20847294\">11</a>-<a href=\"#25271726\">13</a>]. Intuitively, it\u2019s also not entirely unexpected; the goal of antibiotics are to kill bacteria. Therefore, a systemic dose of antibiotics will likely come with off-target effects.\n",
      "\n",
      "Among lifestyle factors, we see the one dietary variable, the number of types of plants consumed in a week, has the largest influence. This effect is larger than the effect of recent antibiotic use. Long term dietary patterns are known to have a strong effect on the microbiome [<a href=\"#22797518\">6</a>-<a href=\"#21885731\">8</a>]. In conjunction with this finding, we also observe that daily alcohol consumption has a smaller effect on the microbiome than plant consumption, or age, but a larger effect than obesity. We also found that sleep duration has a moderate effect. Individuals who sleep less six hours or less per night have less diversity and shifted microbiomes than those who sleep more than eight hours per night. This effect is larger than the effect of obesity. Circadian dysfunction has been linked to obesity, although the mechanism frequently cited is a disruption of mammalian core clock genes [<a href=\"#23434278\">37</a>]. Exercise is known to have an effect on the microbiome, and the effect of daily exercise, compared to those who exercise less than once a week, is noticeable, but small in the scheme of effects investigated here [<a href=\"#25021423\">38</a>,<a href=\"#24670791\">39</a>]. The effect of daily exercise on beta diversity is of the same order of magnitude as the effect of obesity, while the effect on alpha diversity is much larger. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also find strong effects associated with temporal variation. Changes in the microbiome at the extremes of the human lifespan - from early development to the effects of aging on the microbiome have been well studied [<a href=\"#20668239\">3</a>-<a href=\"#22797518\">6</a>]. The most extreme changes in the microbiome occur during the first three years of life, and involves changes in body site composition [<a href=\"#20668239\">3</a>,<a href=\"#22699611\">4</a>,<a href=\"#20566857\">40</a>]. We see a strong effect of age in adults: age has almost as large an effect on beta diversity as antibiotic use, although the effect on alpha diversity is much smaller. \n",
      "\n",
      "We also see a seasonal effect, which was previously observed in a population of 60 matched samples [<a href=\"#24618913\">26</a>]. The effect of collection season on the microbiome is on the same order as the effect we see for sleep duration, and larger than the effect seen for obesity. This may encourage a shift in experiment design. At a minimum, it suggests that tracking collection date in human microbiome studies may be important. \n",
      "Our power analysis allows us to rank the effect sizes of disease, lifestyle, and temporal factors on the human microbiome. We find that effect sizes are generally larger in beta diversity than alpha diversity, suggesting that most changes associated with the extreme states are caused by changes in the taxa present in communities between the two states. A more concerning aspect to the power analysis, however, suggests that many cross-sectional microbiome studies currently in the literature are underpowered. We hope the effect size predictions here can serve as a guide for future studies, and encourage appropriate selection of populations.\n",
