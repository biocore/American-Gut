    "\n",
    "While null hypothesis statistical testing demonstrates whether something has an effect, effect sizes are used to  estimate the importance of an effect. There have have been many call in medical literature for the inclusion of effect size along with statistical p-values, as effect sizes increase the accuracy of comparison [[1](#17944619), [2](#23997866)]. We can leverage effect sizes within microbiome research in multiple ways. Understanding the effect size may help us rank which factors affect the microbiome the most. This, in turn, could help identify targets for intervention. Effect size can also help us design better studies. In the context of statistical power, effect size can help us estimate how many samples we might need to be reasonably confident that our hypothesis  is true, given some margin of error.\n",
    "\n",
    "The complex relation between humans and their resident microbes, especially the microbes in their guts, has been recognized in many areas of human health. Our microbial communities change during the course of our lives, although most of this change occurs within the first three years of life [[3](#20668239)-[6](#22797518)]. Long-term dietary patterns also have a large influence on the gut microbiome, although certain extreme dietary changes can force an acute change [[6](#22797518)-[9](#24336217)]. The gut microbiome can also be re-shaped by antibiotic use [[10](#20736229)-[12](#20352091)]. Microbiome alterations (dysbiosis) have also been reported in a number of diseases. Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and obesity are well studied examples in which the disease state is associated with dysbiosis [[13](#25307765)-[18](#24009397)]. Seasonal changes in the microbiome have also been reported [[19](#24618913)]. We will demonstrate that in a healthy population of adults, age, alcohol consumption, exercise frequency, and sleep duration also impact the gut  microbiome.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of factors that interact with the microbiome is based on the results of significance testing and does not consider effect size. However, effect size is still an important consideration in microbiome research for both experimental design and possible interventions. Using the American Gut data, we  demonstrate that antibiotic use in the month prior to sample collection is associated with significantly decreased alpha diversity, compared with people who have not used antibiotics in the past year (*p* < 0.01). We also show that people who drink alcohol regularly (three or more times per week) have higher alpha diversity than those who do not consume alcohol (*p* < 0.01). \n",
    "\n",
    "If these results were published, one can imagine a situation in which popular media might advise the regular consumption of alcohol use following a dose of antibiotics to help repopulate the microbiome. If we ignore the number of logical fallacies associated with this practice and assume that regular alcohol consumption is able to reseed the gut microbiome in a healthy way, the question then becomes if this will be an effective treatment. (Of course, this represents only one of many potential examples, and no real data beyond the significant association between alcohol consumption and microbiome diversity exists to support this mechanism.) Regular alcohol consumption following antibiotic use might be a good treatment strategy, if the effect size of alcohol consumption is on the same order or greater than the effect of antibiotic use. On the other hand, if the effect size of alcohol consumption is less than that of antibiotic use, encouraging adults who do not drink or drink rarely to increase their alcohol consumption may not lead to the desired effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "The American Gut data set presents a rare opportunity for effect size prediction within the microbiome field. The large size and high degree of heterogeneity among participants and the amount of survey metadata collected from each participant facilitates the examination of effect size for factors that are either currently uncharacterized or under characterized in microbiome research. The accompanying challenge is that effect size calculations are difficult for the type of data collected in microbiome research. Most traditional effect size metrics for comparing samples between groups, such as Cohen’s *d*, make assumptions about the normality of the data being studied, while microbiome data is not normal. As a result, we will leverage a method of empirically estimating statistical power.\n",

    "### Statistical Hypotheses and Error: A “toy” example\n",
    "Using statistics, we can test hypotheses. For example, we might want to test whether or not individual toy bricks cost different amounts depending on which playset they come from. Perhaps we’re trying to build the most epic toy brick playset to represent places where the microbiome is studied, and we’re trying to do this in the cheapest way possible. We’ve determined that there are two relatively inexpensive sets which contain a specific brick we want: a chemistry laboratory and a komodo dragon enclosure. However, we’d also like to repurpose the rest of the bricks in the sets. So, we’d like to consider the cost per brick in each of  the sets.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we’re going to test the hypothesis that the cost per brick in the lab playset is different from the cost per brick in the komodo dragon playset. We can write two possible outcomes for our statistical test, and call them hypotheses:\n",
    "<center><strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong>: The playset type is not related to the cost per brick<br/>\n",
    "(cost<sub>lab</sub> = cost<sub>dragon</sub>)</center>\n",
    "<center><strong>H<sub>1</sub></strong>: The playset type is related to the cost per brick<br/>\n",
    "(cost<sub>lab</sub> $\\neq$ cost<sub>dragon</sub>)</center>\n",
    "\n",
    "In an ideal world, we would be able to collect information about every set sold in the country, which statisticians would call the *population*. But, presumably, this is a side project, and we don’t have enough time or energy to be able to collect information about every single toy brick set of a particular model sold at every single store in the country.\n",
    "Rather than collect information about every single set in the country, let’s assume that we were able to collect price information the three playsets per  week at three stores across the country during the 2013 calendar year. Let’s call each record of a playset price an *observation*. The total set of observations of each model is a *sample*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, we will try to use consistent language, and a *sample* will refer to a set of *observations* (whether they be the cost of toy brick playsets, randomly drawn data points, dice rolls, or diversity metrics calculated after sequencing physical 16S swabs). This differs slightly from the use of “samples” in other American Gut documentation, where “sample” refers to a physical specimen and the resultant 16S data."

    "Our statistical test can make a mistake in two ways. We can reject <strong>H<sub>0</sub></strong> when it is, in fact, true. This leads to a false positive. In our toy example, this would be drawing the conclusion that the bricks within the two sets cost significantly different amounts, when in fact, they don’t. In a medical context, this might mean saying that someone has cancer, when in fact, they do not. Statisticians try to limit the risk associated with false positives by selecting a critical value, sometimes called $\\alpha$. The critical value is the acceptable probability that a false positive has occured. Statistical tests calculate a *p* value, which is the probability a false positive has occurred. The comparison of *p* values and critical values prompts rejection, or failure to reject a hypothesis. The null hypothesis is rejected when $p < \\alpha$.\n",

    "### A More Formal Mathematical Defination for Power Analysis\n",
    "Traditionally, statistical power can only be calculated for certain types of data and certain statistical tests. Most effect size measures make assumptions about the distribution of the data (for example, Cohen’s $f^{2}$ is the power of an ANOVA, which assumes a normal distribution) [[20](#Cohen), [21](#Zar)]. Unfortunately, most microbiome data violates one or more traditional assumptions. For example, many bacterial taxa are sparsely represented and therefore do not follow a normal distribution [[22](#23284876)]. One approach to overcome problems associated with non-normal distributions is to use permutations [[23](#Bondini)]. We have applied a permutative approach to empirically estimate power for microbiome data.\n",

From each of these populations, there exist samples, $\\{ S_{1}, S_{2}, ... , S_{k} \\}$ of sizes $N_{1}, N_{2}, ... , N_{k}$ and characterized by some parameter,  $X$ where $X \\approx \\chi$.\n",

When alpha diversity values are compared, the comparison does not take into account the community structure. So, two communities which share no species can have the same alpha diversity. American Gut Analyses primarily focus on an alpha diversity metric called PD Whole Tree Diversity [[25](#15831718)].

    "The empirical power calculation method in [scikit-bio](http://scikit-bio.org/docs/0.2.2/generated/skbio.stats.power.html#module-skbio.stats.power) is based on iteration. It works by matching pairs of observations based on a set of metadata categories. A number of observations (set using **`min_counts`**, **`max_counts`**, and **`counts_interval`**) are then drawn at random from this set of matched data, and a statistical test is performed. This is repeated a number of times (given by **`num_iter`**), and the fraction of samples below a critical value (**`p_crit`**) is calculated as the power at that sample depth. This is repeated several times to determine the empirical power with some degree of confidence.\n",

As a result, it is most convenient to combine the category with the groups in the category we wish to analyze. We also select our control categories here.

We can do this either by generating new files (if overwrite is True, or the data from the analysis has not already been saved somewhere), or by loading the analysis files which already exist. Since power analysis can be computationally expensive, users who may need to reference or adjust their power curves (for example, playing with the metadata categories being examined) are encouraged to save their intermediate files, so these can be re-loaded.

The scikit bio function we’re using will draw fecal samples which are matched for the control categories we set earlier, but either belong to group 1 or group 2 in the category we’re varying. If we’re varying a category that is also a control category (for example, if we’re looking at the power for IBD), this will be removed from the control categories. Once again, we have the option of saving, and then loading the analysis files, if necessary. In its current incarnation, this notebook can be run on a personal computer.

Keep in mind that these are not the actual number of samples which need to be collected. A variety of factors, including a low biomass sample and sheer dumb luck, may contribute to or prevent a sample from being amplified during PCR. We expect between 80 and 95% of samples to be amplified, depending on the source. If samples are low biomass, difficult to obtain, or cannot be resequenced for some reason, technical replicates may be used to help correct for this sequencing failure. Within the American Gut Project, we resequence the second swab if the first fails to amplify."

    "From our empirical effect size estimations, we can begin to rank effects of different factors on the microbiome. As demonstrated by the Human Microbiome Project (HMP), body site has the largest effect on the human microbiome [[24](#22699609)].\n",
    "\n",
    "We find that an IBD diagnosis has one of the largest impacts on the gut microbiome. While dysbiosis in IBD is likely a complex relationship between the host genetics, host lifestyle, and the microbiome, the disease is characterized by a profoundly altered microbiome and intestinal inflammation [[13](#25307765)-[15](#25567118)]. As with IBD, the microbiome is considered strongly predictive of obesity [[16](#18407065), [17](#19043404), [28](#25538312)]. However, we find the effect of obesity on the microbiome is smaller than lifestyle factors like sleep and exercise for both alpha and beta diversity. This finding is corroborated, to some degree, by a recent meta analysis which observed consistent  IBD-related microbial signatures across studies while obesity-related dysbiosis was more strongly influence by technical effects [[13](#25307765)].\n",
    "\n",
    "We might have predicted the difference in magnitude of these effects based gut pathology. IBD has been recognized as a disease of the intestines and a diagnosis is based on intestinal pathology [[29](#19653289), [30](#21530745)]. It’s likely the complex interactions of IBD-specific bacteria and bacterial strains and host inflammation shapes the community structure in a unique way. It seems less likely we will see such a strong disease-associated effect in conditions that do not traditionally have gut involvement. It might be more reasonable to expect they will have an effect size closer to obesity.\n",
    "\n",
    "We also find that antibiotic use has a large effect on both alpha and beta diversity. This has been previously recognized [[10](#20736229)-[12](#20352091)]. Intuitively, it’s also not entirely unexpected; the goal of antibiotic treatment is  to kill bacteria. Therefore, a systemic dose of antibiotics will likely be associated  with off-target effects.\n",

    "Among lifestyle factors, we see the one dietary variable, the number of types of plants consumed in a week, has the largest influence. This effect is larger than the effect of recent antibiotic use. Long term dietary patterns are known to have a strong effect on the microbiome [[6](#22797518)-[9](#24336217)]. In conjunction with this finding, we also observe that daily alcohol consumption has a smaller effect on the microbiome than plant consumption, or age, but a larger effect than obesity.<br>\n",
    "We also found that sleep duration has a moderate effect. Individuals who sleep less six hours or less  each night have a less diverse, shifted gut microbiome than those who sleep more than eight hours per night. This effect is larger than the effect of obesity. Circadian dysfunction has been linked to obesity, although the mechanism frequently cited is a disruption of mammalian core clock genes [[31](#23434278)].<br>\n",
    "Exercise is known to have an effect on the microbiome, and the effect of daily exercise, compared to those who exercise less than once a week, is noticeable, but small in the scheme of the effects investigated here [[32](#25021423), [33](#24670791)]. The effect of daily exercise on beta diversity is of the same order of magnitude as the effect of obesity, while the effect on alpha diversity is much larger.<br>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also find strong effects associated with temporal variation. Changes in the microbiome at the extremes of the human lifespan - from early development to the effects of aging on the microbiome have been well studied [[3](#20668239)-[6](#22797518)]. The most extreme changes in the microbiome occur during the first three years of life; an infant’s microbiome is highly plastic and does not resemble an adult microbiome at the same site  [[3](#20668239), [4](#22699611), [34](#20566857)]. We see a strong effect of age in adults: age has almost as large an effect on beta diversity as antibiotic use, although the effect on alpha diversity is much smaller. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also see a seasonal effect, which was previously observed in a population of 60 matched samples [[19](#24618913)]. The effect of collection season on the microbiome is on the same order as the effect we see for sleep duration, and larger than the effect seen for obesity. This may encourage a shift in experiment design. At a minimum, it suggests that tracking collection date in human microbiome studies may be important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our power analysis allows us to rank the effect sizes of disease, lifestyle, and temporal factors on the human microbiome. We find that effect sizes are generally larger in beta diversity than in alpha diversity analyses, suggesting that most changes associated with the extreme states are caused by changes in the taxa present between the two states. A more concerning aspect to the power analysis, however, suggests that many cross-sectional microbiome studies currently in the literature are underpowered. We hope the effect size predictions here can serve as a guide for future studies, and encourage appropriate sample size selection.\n",
